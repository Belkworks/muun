# muun

A minimal Lua class implementation that is compatible with [moonscript](https://github.com/leafo/moonscript) classes.  

muun can extend classes defined in moonscript from Lua code, and define classes in Lua code that can be extended from moonscript code.

## How to use
### Extending moonscript classes from Lua code
```lua
local class = require('muun')
local MoonScriptClass = require('MoonScriptClass') -- the class we want to extend

local ExtendedClass = class('ExtendedClass', MoonScriptClass)

 -- override constructor
function ExtendedClass:new(x, y)	
	self:super() -- calls MoonScriptClass constructor

	self.x, self.y = x, y
	print("Hi! My position is:", x, y)
end

-- create an instance
local instance = ExtendedClass(23, 42)
```
---
### Extending classes written in Lua from moonscript code
```lua
local class = require('muun')

BaseClass = class('BaseClass')

function BaseClass:new()
	print("Hi from Lua")
end

function BaseClass:__inherited(cls)
	print(self.__name, "inherited from", cls.__name)
end

```
```moonscript
BaseClass = require('BaseClass')

class Derived extends BaseClass
	new: =>
		super! -- calls the BaseClass constructor
		print("Hi from moonscript!")

test = Derived!
```
#### Output
```
Derived	inherited from 	BaseClass
Hi from Lua!
Hi from moonscript!
```
---
### Define a class in Lua

muun can also be used as a minimal, but fully functional Lua class implementation.

#### Variant 1
```lua
-- define class
local MyClass = class('MyClass', {
	 -- define constructor
	new = function(self, x, y)
		self.x, self.y = x, y
		print("Hi! My position is:", x, y)
	end,
})

-- create instance
local instance = MyClass(23, 42)
```

#### Variant 2
```lua
local MyClass = class('MyClass')

 -- define constructor
function MyClass:new(x, y)
	self.x, self.y = x, y
	print("Hi! My position is:", x, y)
end

-- create instance
local instance = MyClass(23, 42)
```

#### Variant 3
```lua
local MyClass = {
	 -- define constructor
	new = function(self, x, y)
		self.x, self.y = x, y
		print("Hi! My position is:", x, y)
	end,
}

-- define class
MyClass = class('MyClass', MyClass)

-- create instance
local instance = MyClass(23, 42)
```
---
### Inheritance
All derived classes have a `super` method that can call the current function upwards.

If a class implements the `__inherited` method, it gets called whenever another class extends this class.
```lua
local Base = class('Base')

function Base:new(...)
    print("Hi from Base!")
end

function Base:foo()
    print("Foo!")
end

function Base.__inherited(parent, cls)
    print(cls.__name .. " inherited from " .. parent.__name)
end

local Derived = class('Derived', Base)

function Derived:new(...)
    self:super(...)
    print("Hi from Derived!")
end

function Derived:foo()
    self:super()
    print("Bar!")
end

local instance = Derived()
instance:foo()
```

### Output:
```
Derived inherited from Base
Hi from Base!
Hi from Derived!
Foo!
Bar!
```
